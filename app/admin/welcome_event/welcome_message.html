        <h1> You've Created a New Event! </h1>
        <p>
            Try downloading the Notifsta app on your phone, sign in, and take a look around. However your event isn't publicly visible yet - only you and other admins can see this event on their phones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you're happy with how everything looks, click the "Publish Event" on your admin dashboard and after paying $50.00 you'll be good to go!
